### Homework Description

In this assignment you will work on files in the `src/` directory exclusively.  You will need to
add new code and modify existing code.  This assignment will be graded manually and **NOT** via unit tests.  You will need to create the table and seed the database with the `sql` files in the `db/` directory. Please only use the database listed as the SQL will only work there. Here are some url's that you need to paste into your web browser.

* [http://localhost/Validation.php?col_string=Two&col_number=2](http://localhost/Validation.php?col_string=Two+OR+1=1--&col_number=2)
* [http://localhost/SQLInjection.php?col_string=%27Two%27+OR+1=1--&col_number=2](http://localhost/SQLInjection.php?col_string=%27Two%27+OR+1=1--&col_number=2)

### Steps

#### Part 1 - Data Validation

#### Part 2 - SQL Injection

* See an example of SQL Injection and fix it using PHP Data Objects. Work on the `src/SQLInjection.php`.
